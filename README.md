# FetchApi
Fetch Data from Api in Angular@v17
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************
1) httpClient = inject(HttpClient);: This line injects the HttpClient service from Angular's dependency injection system. The inject function is a helper function used to retrieve a service from the injector, which manages the creation and lifecycle of services in your Angular application. The HttpClient service allows you to make HTTP requests to web APIs.*******
2) data: any = [];: This line declares a variable named data and initializes it as an empty array. This array will be used to store the fetched product data from the API.
3) ngOnInit(): This is a lifecycle hook method in Angular components. It's called automatically by Angular after the component's constructor is executed and its view is initialized. This is a common place to perform any initialization tasks or data fetching that needs to happen after the component is fully set up.
4) this.fetchData();: Inside the ngOnInit method, the code calls the fetchData method. This is likely where you'll make the API call to retrieve the product data.
5) fetchData(): This is a method defined within the component. It's responsible for fetching data from the API.
this.httpClient.get('https://dummyjson.com/products'): Here, the get method of the HttpClient service is used to make a GET request to the specified URL (https://dummyjson.com/products). This URL points to an API endpoint that likely provides information about products. The get method returns an Observable, which is a stream of data that the component can subscribe to.
6) .subscribe((data: any) => { ... }): The subscribe method is used to subscribe to the Observable returned by the get method. The function passed to subscribe is called whenever the Observable emits new data (in this case, the product data).
7) (data: any) =>: This part defines the parameters that the subscription function will receive. Here, it's expecting an object named data of type any. This is because the structure of the response from the API is not explicitly defined in the code.
8) this.data = data.products;: Inside the subscription function, the received data (data) is assumed to have a property called products. This line extracts the products array from the response and assigns it to the previously declared data variable in the component. This effectively stores the product information from the API in the component's state.
